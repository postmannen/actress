// Event defines an event. It holds:
//   - The Name, which specifies the process are meant for.
//   - The Cmd, are meant to but not limited to be a way to give
//     instructions for what a process should do. The receiving
//     process are responsible for parsing the string slice into
//     something useful.
//   - The Data field are ment to carry the result from the work
//     done by a process, to the next process.
//   - Both Cmd and Data can be used interchangeably if it makes
//     more sense for a given scenario. No strict rules for this
//     exist. Just make sure to document the use of the given
//     Name, so the structure of how to use the fields exist.
//   - Err, are used by the error event type (ER).
//   - NextEvent are used when we want to define a chain of events
//     to be executed. The processes must make use of the field
//     for this to work. Check out the examples folder for a simple
//     example for how it could be implemented.
